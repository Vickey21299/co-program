# 🧠 co-program: Assembly to Binary Encoder

## 📌 Overview
This project is a part of my **Computer Organization** coursework. It simulates how a CPU interprets low-level instructions by converting **custom assembly language instructions** into **binary machine code**. The tool mimics a simple assembler and reinforces understanding of instruction formats, register encoding, and CPU datapath design.

## 💡 Key Concepts
- Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
- Register-level operations
- Binary encoding of instructions
- Bitwise manipulation
- Low-level CPU simulation

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The program accepts simplified assembly instructions, like:

MOV R1, R2
ADD R3, R4

2. Each instruction and register is mapped to a binary opcode or register code.
3. The instruction is encoded into a binary format using bitwise operations.
4. The binary output simulates what is executed by the processor.

### 🔢 Example
**Input:**

MOV R1, R2

**Output:**

0001 0001 0010

- `0001` → opcode for `MOV`
- `0001` → register code for `R1`
- `0010` → register code for `R2`

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- C/C++ for performance and bit-level control
- Bitwise operators for encoding
- Custom instruction format (modeled after MIPS or x86)

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Understood how assemblers convert instructions into machine-readable format
- Practiced encoding instruction formats and register references
- Strengthened knowledge of CPU design and datapath processing
- Reinforced Computer Organization fundamentals through simulation

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add support for branching instructions (e.g., `JMP`, `BEQ`)
- Implement a disassembler (Binary → Assembly)
- Build a simple CLI tool for interactive encoding
- Export binary/hex output to `.bin` or `.hex` files
